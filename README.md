# NUI-LU
This is "Prime Label Learning from Multi-label Aerial Image: A Novel Weakly Supervised Task" paper.

# Introduction
1. The task of prime label learning for aerial images is proposed, which aims to automatically obtain the label that best represents the semantics of the image among its multi-labels without increasing the training cost.
2. On the basis of commonly used multi-label aerial image datasets, three prime label aerial image datasets are provided on which the benchmarks have been established.
3. A Non-Uniform Initialization based Label Update (NUI-LU) prime label learning algorithm is proposed, which achieves state-of-the-art on this task.
